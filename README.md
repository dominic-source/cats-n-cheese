## 🐱 Game Overview

- **Players**: 4 players (1 human, 3 computer-controlled)
- **Rounds**: 8 rounds per game
- **Objective**: Collect the most cheese cards by the end of the game

## 📜 How to Play

1. **Setup**: Each cat starts with 1-4 cheese slices.
2. **Target Selection**: Players secretly choose which cat to steal from by clicking on a cat card.
3. **Cheese Collection**: 
   - If you're the only player targeting a cat, you successfully steal all its cheese!
   - If multiple players target the same cat, the cat becomes aware, and no one gets the cheese.
4. **Round Progression**: Cats receive new cheese each round, increasing their cheese pile.

## 🏆 Winning the Game

The mouse (player) with the most collected cheese at the end of 8 rounds wins!
